title: Rate limits
description: RPM, concurrency, and daily caps.

Rate limits are enforced per project to protect your keys and budgets.

## Limit types

- **RPM:** Requests per minute.
- **Concurrency:** Max in-flight requests.
- **Daily caps:** Total requests per day.

## Managing limits

Use **Rate Limits** in the console to configure values per project. You can
reset to recommended defaults at any time.

## When limits are exceeded

The gateway returns `429` with `error.code=rate_limit_exceeded` and a
`retry-after` header (seconds). Respect the header before retrying.
