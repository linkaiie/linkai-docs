## Usage dashboards

The **Usage** page aggregates activity by day, model, or API key. Use it to:

- Monitor total requests and error rate.
- Track token usage and credit spend.
- Export CSVs for reporting.

## Request logs

The **Logs** page shows per-request details:

- Status code and latency.
- Model name and token usage.
- Error messages for failed requests.

Use filters (key, status, model) and pagination to pinpoint issues quickly.
