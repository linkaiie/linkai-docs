## When are credits applied after a top-up?

Credits are added after Stripe payment confirmation via webhook.

## Which models are supported?

Model names are passed through to the upstream provider. Use a model that your
provider supports, or contact support for a recommended list.

## Can I use the OpenAI SDK?

Yes. Set the `baseURL` to `https://api.linkai.ie/v1` and use your LinkAI Route
API key.

## Is streaming supported?

Yes. Send `stream: true` to `/v1/chat/completions` and read SSE chunks until
`[DONE]`.

## Why did my request fail with 402?

Your credit balance is below 1. Top up credits to continue.
