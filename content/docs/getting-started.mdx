description: Create an API key and send your first request.
---

## Create your account

1. Sign in to the console at `https://route.linkai.ie`.
2. Create a project for your app or team.
3. Generate an API key from **API Keys**. The full key is shown once.
4. Top up credits in **Billing** to activate the key.

## Send your first request

```bash
curl https://api.linkai.ie/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <LINKAI_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"openai/gpt-oss-120b","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

## Streaming (SSE)

```bash
curl -N https://api.linkai.ie/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <LINKAI_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"openai/gpt-oss-120b","stream":true,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
  Use `-N` to disable buffering so tokens stream immediately.
</Callout>

## Next steps

- Learn the full request schema in **Chat Completions API**.
