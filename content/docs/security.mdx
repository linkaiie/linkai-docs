## API key storage

- Keys are shown once on creation.
- Store keys in server-side secrets, not in client code.
- Rotate keys on a schedule or after any exposure.

## Access control

- Use separate keys per environment.
- Disable unused keys immediately.

## Data hygiene

- Avoid sending API keys in query strings.
- Use request IDs for traceability (`x-request-id`).

## Response safety

Provider-specific fields are stripped by default to keep responses compatible
and minimize accidental leakage.
