## Projects

Projects are the unit of billing and rate limits. Create a separate project for
prod/staging or different teams.

## API keys

- Create keys under **API Keys**.
- Keys are shown once; only hash + prefix are stored.
- Actions: rename, disable, rotate, delete.
- The key overview shows recent usage and spend.

## Billing

- Top up credits via Stripe Checkout.
- Orders show status, session id, payment intent id, and webhook confirmation.
- The Stripe portal opens in a new tab for payment methods.

## Usage

- View usage by day, model, or API key.
- Export CSV for the current view or logs for recent days.

## Logs

- Filter by API key, status, and model.
- Pagination supports 20/50/100 rows per page.

## Settings

- Deleting a project requires typing the project name.
- Deleted projects return `403` for all requests.
