## API keys

API keys are created in the console under **API Keys**. The full key is shown
only once, and the server stores only a hash + prefix. Store keys securely (for
example in a secret manager or environment variable).

Example format:

```
lkar_********************************
```

## Request headers

Every API request must include:

- `Authorization: Bearer <LINKAI_API_KEY>`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

## Idempotency and request IDs

LinkAI Route uses a request ID for logging and idempotency checks. You can
provide your own ID via either header:

- `x-request-id: <uuid>`
- `idempotency-key: <uuid>`

If the same request ID is re-used, the gateway returns `409` with
`error.code=idempotency_conflict`.

## Key management

- Rotate keys regularly for long-lived integrations.
- Disable a key immediately if it is exposed.
- Use separate keys per environment (prod/staging/dev).
