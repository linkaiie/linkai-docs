title: Billing & credits
description: How credits are purchased, tracked, and enforced.

## Credits model

Credits are charged based on token usage. Each request consumes at least 1
credit, and token usage is reported in the `usage` field of responses.

```
credits_charged = max(1, ceil(total_tokens / 1000 * credits_per_1k))
```

`credits_per_1k` depends on your plan or pricing tier.

## Top-ups

1. Open **Billing** in the console.
2. Choose a preset tier or enter a custom amount.
3. Complete Stripe Checkout.
4. Credits are added after webhook confirmation.

## Refunds and negative balances

Refunds add negative ledger entries. If your balance goes below zero, the
gateway will return `402` until you top up again.

## Payment methods

Use **Manage payment methods (Stripe portal)** to update cards in a new tab.
